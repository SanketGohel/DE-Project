# Data Modeling with PostgreSQL
* A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their music streaming app.The analytics team is particulary interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to do query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

* We created a Postgres database and ETL pipeline for this analysis with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.


## Schema Design

### Fact Table

* songplay: Records in log data associated with song plays i.e records with page NextSong songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent.
